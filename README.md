   > - Click "Open Anyway" for IPSW Firmware Analyzer

### Option 2: Run from Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TermuxHackz/Enhanced-IPSW-Firmware-Analysis-Tool.git
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 ipsw_firmware_tool.py
   ```

### System Requirements
- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 500MB free disk space for installation
- Additional space required for IPSW analysis (varies by firmware size)


## Logs
- Logs from the application are saved in:
<code>~/Library/Logs/IPSWComparisonTool</code>


### Basic Operation

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Run the script to open the GUI interface

2. **Select Firmware Files**
   - Click "Browse" to select your first IPSW file
   - Select the second IPSW file for comparison
   - Click "Analyze Firmware Files" to begin analysis

3. **View Results**
   Results are organized into three main tabs:
   - **Summary**: Overview of key changes and recommendations
   - **Technical Details**: In-depth technical analysis of modifications
   - **Impact Analysis**: Evaluation of potential impacts on device operation

### Understanding Results

#### Summary Tab
- Overview of total changes
- Critical component modifications
- Security update summary
- Update priority assessment
- Recommendations for installation

#### Technical Details Tab
- Detailed component-level changes
- File modifications list
